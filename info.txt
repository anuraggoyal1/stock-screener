Important Considerations for Cloud Run:
Persistence: Cloud Run services are stateless. Currently, your app saves data to 
data/master.csv
 inside the container. This data will be wiped every time the service scales down or restarts. For production, you should migrate to a database (like Cloud SQL or Firestore).
Secrets: Your 
config.yaml
 contains sensitive API keys. In a production environment, you should avoid baking these into the image. Instead:
Upload secrets to Google Secret Manager.
Map them to environment variables in Cloud Run.
Modify 
backend/config.py
 to check for environment variables before looking at the YAML file.
Authentication: If you are using Google Cloud Run, ensure the callback URL in your Upstox/Zerodha dashboards matches your newly deployed frontend URL.
Would you like me to help you update the 
backend/config.py
 to support Environment Variables for easier secret management?
